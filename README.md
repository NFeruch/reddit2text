## Installation
Easy install using pip
```sh
pip3 install reddit2text
```

<a id="quickstart"></a>

## Quickstart
**First**, you need to create a Reddit app to get your **client_id** and **client_secret**, in order to access the Reddit API.
> Here's a [visual step-by-step guide I created](https://scribehow.com/shared/Create_your_Reddit_API_app__sanm5Eo2Q_iudzfhFZLKJg) to do this! Alternatively, you can look at [Reddit's API documentation](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/api).


**Then**, replace the `client_id`, `client_secret`, and `user_agent` with your credentials.

The user agent can be anything you like, but we recommend following this convention according to Reddit's guidelines: `'<app type>:<app name>:<version> (by <your username>)'`

<a id="example"></a>

***This is enough to get started:***
```python
from reddit2text import Reddit2Text

r2t = Reddit2Text(
    # replace with your actual creds
    client_id='123abc',
    client_secret='123abc',
    user_agent='script:my_app:v1.0 (by u/reddit2text)'
)

URL = 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1by3p2o/whats_the_stupidest_animal_and_how_has_it/'

output = r2t.textualize_post(URL)
print(output)
```

<a id="configs"></a>

## Extra Configuration
- **max_comment_depth**, `Optional[str]`:
  - Maximum depth of comments to output. Includes the top-most comment. Defaults to `None` or `-1` to include all.
- **comment_delim**, `Optional[str]`:
  - String/character used to indent comments according to their nesting level. Defaults to `|` to mimic reddit.

```python
r2t = Reddit2Text(
    # credentials ...
    max_comment_depth=3,  # all comment chains will be limited to a max of 3 replies
    comment_delim='#'  # each comment level will be preceded by multiples of this string
)
```

<a id="features"></a>

## Current Features
- Convert any Reddit thread (the post + all its comments) into structured text.
- Include all comments, with the ability to specify the maximum comment depth.
- Configure a custom comment delimiter, for visual separation of nested comments.
